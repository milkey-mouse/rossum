# Rossum

Software for a robot. A Raspberry Pi runs this code to host a webpage that lets you upload new code to an Arduino (which is actually connected to the motors). They can then communicate via serial.
I abandoned this because I changed the hardware on the robot, but it could still be useful for updating an Arduino from a Chromebook or something.
